(Starbound 1.0+) A large mod that adds many new mechs, vehicles, a new playable race, enemies, weapons, tools and more!
After the official release of ths mod, it will be continuously updated to patch out bugs, 
rebalance items and weapons and to add more content overall. Upon recieving requests for content I will
check to see if such a request is possible to add, and if so I will begin adding it.
